      8 years ago Confex decided to stop building CRE machines because our service and support business was increasing, many companies had machines that they had little or no training on and that used old tooling and processes. Our process knowledge which came direct from a production environment meant that we were able to firstly solve the problems and then ensure that the customer stayed at a high level of production.

      1. Upgrade the tooling, wheels and dies to the most recent production technology to make a better product and reduce defects
      2. Increase the line speed and lower the scrap rates making the process more profitable
      3. Keep the consumable items in stock so that a customer can place an order and take delivery of parts within a few days rather than 6 weeks

      Many machines use old processes and we are able to help in the following areas:

      1. Improve the coiling of the product on the drum, the product will never be stretched and the lay will be even meaning that when the product is decoiled for the next process it is in good condition and hasnâ€™t picked up any damage.
      2. On older machines we are able to replace the old headframe with new
      3. Refurbishment of old parts to an almost new condition such as shoes.
      4. We can supply complete new control systems
