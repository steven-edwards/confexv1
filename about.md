# Company Profile

Confex Technology have since 1993 specialised in Continuous Rotary Extrusion systems.

Confex Technology Ltd was formed in 1993 by David Godwin, who prior to forming Confex was involved in the start up of Holton Machinery including design, development and sales of CRE machines.

Together with other ex-Holton Machinery engineers now employed by Confex, we have supplied many Continuous Rotary Extrusion Lines both as Confex and together with our partners.

In 2008 we took the decision to buy our own purpose built offices and warehouse based in Poole, Dorset, UK. Here we hold a large stock of spares, tooling and dies, carry out refurbishment and assembly of items such as extrusion shoes and head frame assemblies.
